1. Setup Vert.x Project
Initialize a Vert.x project in Java.
Include necessary dependencies like Vert.x core, Vert.x web, etc.
2. Question Bank Creation
Create a question bank containing at least 60 questions.
Store these questions in a database or in-memory storage. Redis could be a good choice for this due to its fast read/write capabilities.
3. Random Question Selection
Implement a function to randomly select 10 questions from the question bank for each exam session.
Ensure that the same question is not selected more than once for a single exam session.
4. Shuffling Choices for Each User
When a question is presented to a user, shuffle the order of the choices.
This shuffling should be unique for each user who takes the exam.
5. Scoring System
Implement a scoring system where:
Correct answer on first attempt: 2 marks.
Incorrect answer on first attempt: Remove the wrong choice and present 3 choices.
Correct answer on second attempt: 1 mark.
Incorrect answer on second attempt: 0 marks.
6. Redis or Caching
Utilize Redis or another caching solution to store the state of the exam for each user.
This includes which questions have been answered, the current score, and the remaining choices for each question.
